A Maternal Wellness Web App for Every Stage of Motherhood

ðŸ©· Overview

BloomBuhay is a maternal wellness web application designed to guide, support, and empower Filipino mothers through pregnancy, postpartum, and early motherhood.

The app combines health tracking, milestone visualization, emotional wellness, and educational content in one secure, user-friendly space.

It allows users to log health data, visualize baby growth, manage tasks and appointments, explore articles, and relax with baby sounds â€” all in one place.

ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Many Filipino mothers struggle to track their health and find reliable, centralized information throughout motherhood.
Most existing apps focus only on pregnancy and neglect postpartum care, mental health, and long-term engagement.

BloomBuhay solves this by providing a holistic, continuous digital companion for mothers â€” before, during, and after pregnancy.
